# tropical-disease-predisposition-xai
A machine learning project focused on predicting the predisposition to tropical diseases in female adults using key risk factors, with explainable AI techniques like LIME to enhance model interpretability.

## üéØ Objectives

- Predict which female adults are at risk of contracting tropical diseases based on biological, Socioeconomic and environmental risk factors.
- Compare the performance of multiple machine learning models.
- Use LIME to make black-box ML predictions interpretable to healthcare professionals.
- Support early intervention and public health monitoring.
